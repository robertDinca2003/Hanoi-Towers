# Description

The Tower of Hanoi is a fascinating puzzle game involving three pegs and a stack of disks. The objective is to move the entire stack from one peg to another while following three simple rules:
- You can only move one disk at a time.
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.
- The goal is to recreate the original stack on a different peg.

This seemingly simple game offers a surprisingly deep challenge, requiring players to think strategically to solve it. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic brain-teaser that has entertained and perplexed puzzle enthusiasts for generations.
